# hackOrsnooze

A project of a hacker-news clone where I was given an application but it was missing a bunch of functionality that needed to be completed using JavaScript.

Using Axios I set up all the functionality to work with the custom API that was built for this project. I added the functionality for users to be able to add stories, like stories, and delete their stories.

I also added other funtionality to the UI to make sure the correct information was shown to a logged in user.
